## Overview

**The Ice Cream Man** is a full-stack mobile application that revolutionizes how customers access ice cream and how vendors operate their businesses. Instead of randomly driving through neighborhoods, ice cream vendors receive real-time requests from customers and can accept orders with one tap. Customers enjoy one-tap ordering, real-time driver tracking, and a delightful user experience with candy-themed graphics.

The platform operates as a two-sided marketplace with distinct customer and vendor interfaces, real-time location tracking, push notifications, and a self-sustaining backend architecture designed for scalability.

---

## Key Features

### For Customers

The customer interface provides an intuitive, kid-friendly experience centered around simplicity and real-time transparency. Users can tap a large ice cream button to request service, track their ice cream truck in real-time on an interactive map with candy-land styling, view order history with vendor ratings, and share the app with friends through built-in referral functionality.

### For Ice Cream Vendors

The vendor dashboard displays incoming customer requests with location details, enabling vendors to accept orders and navigate to customers. Vendors can track their earnings, manage their profile and ratings, and optimize their route between multiple requests. The platform provides automatic routing suggestions to maximize efficiency.

### Platform Features

The application includes real-time location tracking with GPS integration for accurate driver positioning, push notifications for order updates and new requests, a ratings and review system for community trust, and a self-sustaining backend that requires minimal manual intervention. The app features a beautiful candy-pink and cream color theme with kid-friendly graphics and smooth animations throughout.

```

For watch mode during development:

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

### Building for Production

Generate a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This creates optimized bundles for both web and native platforms.

---

## Deployment

### Google Play Store

The app is configured for automated publishing to Google Play Store via EAS Build:

```bash
# Build and submit to Google Play Store
eas build --platform android --auto-submit

# Or build without submitting
eas build --platform android
```

See `GOOGLE_PLAY_PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md` for detailed setup instructions.

### Backend Deployment

The backend is designed to run on Node.js platforms like Vercel, Heroku, or Google Cloud Run:

```bash
# Build production bundle
pnpm build

# Start production server
NODE_ENV=production pnpm start
```

---

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. The app uses Expo Router for file-based routing, enabling automatic route generation from the file structure. State management relies on React Context for global state (authentication, location, requests) and local `useState` for component-level state.

The UI is built with NativeWind, which provides Tailwind CSS utilities for React Native, enabling rapid development and consistent styling across platforms. The theme system supports light and dark modes automatically, with all colors defined in `theme.config.js`.

### Backend Architecture

The backend implements a tRPC-based API for type-safe client-server communication. All routes are organized in separate router files and merged into a single root router. The database layer uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries and automatic migrations.

Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens stored in secure cookies. The system tracks user roles (customer vs. driver) and enforces role-based access control on protected routes.

### Real-Time Features

Location tracking uses a polling mechanism where drivers send their location every 5 seconds. The frontend fetches updated driver locations at the same interval, creating a smooth real-time experience without requiring WebSocket infrastructure.

Push notifications are handled through Expo Notifications, which integrates with native notification systems on iOS and Android.

---

## Database Schema

### Users Table

Stores authentication and profile information for both customers and drivers, including OAuth identifiers, email, name, and role designation.

### Requests Table

Records all ice cream requests with customer location, status (pending, accepted, completed, cancelled), and associated driver information once accepted.

### Drivers Table

Maintains driver-specific information including vehicle details, current location, earnings, and ratings from customers.

### Ratings Table

Stores customer ratings and feedback for drivers, enabling reputation building and quality assurance.

### Location History Table

Tracks driver location history for analytics and route optimization purposes.

---

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

The authentication endpoints handle user registration, login, and logout flows:

- `POST /auth/register` - Register new user (customer or driver)
- `POST /auth/login` - Login with email and password
- `POST /auth/logout` - Logout current user
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile

### Requests (Customer)

Customer-facing endpoints for managing ice cream requests:

- `POST /requests/create` - Create new ice cream request
- `GET /requests/active` - Get current active request
- `GET /requests/history` - Get request history
- `POST /requests/cancel` - Cancel pending request
- `POST /requests/rate` - Rate completed request

### Requests (Driver)

Driver-facing endpoints for managing incoming requests:

- `GET /requests/incoming` - Get nearby incoming requests
- `POST /requests/accept` - Accept a request
- `POST /requests/decline` - Decline a request
- `POST /requests/complete` - Mark request as complete
- `GET /requests/active` - Get current active delivery

### Location

Location tracking endpoints:

- `POST /location/update` - Update driver location
- `GET /location/driver/:driverId` - Get driver current location
- `GET /location/history/:driverId` - Get driver location history

### Profile

User profile management:

- `GET /profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /profile` - Update user profile
- `GET /profile/earnings` - Get driver earnings (driver only)
- `GET /profile/ratings` - Get user ratings

---

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimization

The app uses code splitting through Expo Router to load only necessary code for each screen. Images are optimized with Expo Image component, which handles caching and lazy loading automatically. The Tailwind CSS configuration uses tree-shaking to include only used styles in production builds.

### Backend Optimization

Database queries use indexes on frequently searched columns (user_id, location, status). The API implements pagination for list endpoints to prevent loading large datasets. Response caching is implemented for static data like driver profiles.

### Location Tracking

Instead of continuous WebSocket connections, the app uses efficient polling with 5-second intervals. Location updates are batched to reduce database writes. The map only re-renders when location changes exceed a 10-meter threshold.

---

## Security

### Authentication

All user authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens. Tokens are stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies and automatically refreshed. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.

### Data Protection

The database connection uses SSL encryption. All API endpoints validate input data and sanitize against injection attacks. Sensitive endpoints require authentication and role-based authorization.

### Privacy

The app only requests location permission when needed and explains why. Users can disable location sharing at any time. Location data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

---

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for critical functionality:

### Authentication Tests

Tests verify user registration, login, logout, and token refresh flows work correctly.

### API Tests

Tests ensure all endpoints return correct data, handle errors properly, and enforce authorization.

### Component Tests

Tests verify UI components render correctly and respond to user interactions.

Run all tests with `pnpm test` or watch mode with `pnpm test:watch`.
