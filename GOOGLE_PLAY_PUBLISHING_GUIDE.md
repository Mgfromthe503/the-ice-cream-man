## Quick Start: One-Click Publishing

Once your Google Play Developer account is verified, publishing is automated:

### Step 1: Generate Keystore (One-time Setup)

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/the-ice-cream-man

# Generate Android keystore for signing
keytool -genkey -v -keystore keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias ice-cream-man-key \
  -storepass your_keystore_password \
  -keypass your_key_password
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

```bash
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="your_keystore_password"
export KEY_PASSWORD="your_key_password"
export EAS_BUILD_PROFILE="production"
```

### Step 3: One-Click Publish

```bash
# Build and submit to Google Play Store
eas build --platform android --auto-submit

# Or just build (for manual submission)
eas build --platform android
```

The app will be built and submitted to Google Play Store as a draft. You can then review and publish from Google Play Console.
