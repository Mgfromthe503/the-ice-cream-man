2. Tap **"Start Earning Money →"** on the Ice Cream Vendor card
3. You will see the **"Register Your Truck First!"** screen
4. Tap **"Register My Truck"**
5. Fill in: Name, Truck Name, Truck Color (truck number auto-assigned)
6. After registration form, the **$25 Google Play Billing** payment screen appears

9. The dashboard shows incoming customer requests (if any are waiting)
10. Accept a request → Navigate button opens Google Maps with directions
11. Complete delivery when within 1000 feet of customer

### TEST ACCOUNTS FOR REVIEW (Pre-Configured — No Payment Required)

Two test accounts are pre-configured that bypass all registration and payment flows:

**How to access the test login screen:**
1. On the initial role-select screen ("Choose your role to get started")
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Tap the small gray **"v1.0.0"** version text at the very bottom of the screen
4. This opens the hidden Test Login screen

**Customer Test Account:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | Icecream@customertest.com |
| Password | GoogleTest2026! |

This account bypasses all verification and lands directly on the Customer ordering screen.

**Driver Test Account:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | Icecream@driverlogintest.com |
| Password | GoogleTest2026! |

This account bypasses the $25 registration fee, email verification, and all activation checks. It lands directly on the operational Driver Dashboard with a pre-registered truck (ICM-9999, area code 97005), ready to accept incoming customer requests.

**Alternative (License Tester for real billing flow):**
If you want to test the actual $25 Google Play Billing flow, add your reviewer's Google account as a License Tester in Google Play Console (Setup → License testing) with Payment Response set to RESPOND_NORMALLY (uses test card, no real charge).

### DEMO MODE (If No Active Drivers Available)

When testing the Customer flow, if no real Drivers are online, the app uses a simulated delivery timeline:
- 8 seconds: Driver accepts your order
- 15 seconds: Driver is nearby
- 20 seconds: Delivery arrives

This ensures the reviewer can experience the full customer journey without needing a second device.
